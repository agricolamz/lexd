# Lexd

A lexicon compiler for non-suffixational morphologies.

This module compiles lexicons in a format loosely based on hfst-lexc and produces transducers in ATT format which are equivalent to those produced using the overgenerate-and-constrain approach with hfst-twolc (see [here](http://wiki.apertium.org/wiki/Morphotactic_constraints_with_twol) and [here](http://wiki.apertium.org/wiki/Replacement_for_flag_diacritics)).

To build, do
```bash
./autogen.sh
make
make install
```

To run, do
```bash
lexd lexicon_file att_file
```

To get a speed comparison, do
```bash
make test
```
